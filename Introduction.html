    <ul>
        <li>Personal background: Born in Panama City, FL. Grew up there and enlisted in the US Army after getting AA at Gulf Coast State College. I have 2 Welsh Corgis and have been married for 8 years</li>
        <li>Professional: Spent 5 years in the US Army as an 89D (EOD technician), switched to 15Q (Air Traffic Control Specialist) spent many years working various soul crushing tech retail jobs, Best Buy, Verizon, Dish network, etc.  Looking forward to finding a job in my field of study.</li>
        <li>Academic background: Currently have an associate of arts degree and am 2 semesters away from a BA in Human Computer Interaction.  </li>
        <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I don't have much of a background in any computer science workings. As I grew up I grew fond of video games and learned how to build my own PC and google things well enough to trick someone into thinking I know what I'm doing. Learned a bit about networking and am slowly building my coding knowledge and developing a better understanding of all things computing. </li>
        <li>Primary Computer Platform: Mostly just windows platforms. I have been thinking about making an old laptop run Linux to learn how it works</li>
        <li>Courses I'm taking this semester and reason for each:
            <ul>
                <li>STAT-2223 - Elements of Statistics II - this is required for my BA</li>
                <li>PSYC-1101 - General Psychology - This is a prerequisite for a required course in my BA degree path</li>
                <li>ITIS-3135 - Web App Design and Development- This is also required for my BA and is this class!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
            I have many memorable stories that probably arent appropriate for this forum :D, but one interesting fact about me is that I have begun brewing my own beer and mead.  I am currently making a "historic" recipe for mead that I found in the game Assassins Creed Valhalla.</li>
        <li>I'd also like to share:
            I play disc golf and enjoy just about any video game and genre.  I am also an avid Star Wars fan and will talk about it until I am blue in the face from lack of oxygen.</li>
    </ul>
